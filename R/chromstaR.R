#' Combinatorial analysis of ChIP-seq histone modification data using Hidden Markov Models
#'
#' \pkg{chromstaR} is an R package for the combinatorial or differential analysis of multiple ChIP-seq experiments. It was developed for histone modifications with a broad profile but is also suitable for the analysis of transcription factor binding data. A Hidden Markov Model with a mixture of Negative Binomials as emission densities is used to call peaks. Please read our publication for a detailed description of the method. TODO: insert publication
