#'
#' This package implements functions for the combinatorial and differential analysis of ChIP-seq data. It was developed for histone modifications with a broad profile but is also suitable for the analysis of transcription factor binding data. A Hidden Markov Model with a mixture of Negative Binomials as emission densities is used to call peaks. Please read our publication for a detailed description of the method. TODO: insert publication.
