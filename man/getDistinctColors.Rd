\title{Get distinct colors}
\usage{
getDistinctColors(n, start.color = "blue4", exclude.colors = c("white",
  "black", "gray", "grey", "\\\\<yellow\\\\>", "yellow1", "lemonchiffon"),
  exclude.brightness.above = 1, exclude.rgb.above = 210)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of colors to select. If \code{n} is a character vector, \code{length(n)} will be taken as the number of colors and the colors will be named by \code{n}.}

\item{start.color}{Color to start the selection process from.}

\item{exclude.colors}{Character vector with colors that should not be used.}

\item{exclude.brightness.above}{Exclude colors where the 'brightness' value in HSV space is above. This is useful to obtain a matt palette.}

\item{exclude.rgb.above}{Exclude colors where all RGB values are above. This is useful to exclude whitish colors.}
}
\value{
A character vector with colors.
}
\description{
Get a set of distinct colors selected from \code{\link{colors}}.
}
\details{
The function computes the euclidian distance between all \code{\link{colors}} and iteratively selects those that have the furthest closes distance to the set of already selected colors.
}
\examples{
cols <- getDistinctColors(5)
pie(rep(1,5), labels=cols, col=cols)
